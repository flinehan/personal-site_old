My name is Frank Linehan, and I'm a web developer. I have a passion for the web and enjoy working with the various web based technologies and languages.

I am currently working for [LiveRez](http://www.liverez.com/) as a Front End Engineer. From September 2013, I have worked in the partner facing development team. We drive and improve the way property managers use software.

I live in Boise, Idaho, and enjoy climbing, travel, and of couse web development. I like using new technology and patterns.

In late 2012 I worked at [Netmark](http://www.netmark.com) primarily as a web developer and for a time as a project manager. I implemented SCRUM with experience on the SCRUM planning cycle, from release pre-planning through sprint and capacity planning.

At Netmark, as a web developer, I helped design and impliment 'Netmark tools' using angular.js. The single page app communicated with a rest api written in php-code ignitor.

I am fortunate to have worked with some amazing people. With these people I have had the opertunity to work on some truly awesome projects.

I extremly excited to be working in web development during this exciting time on the web.
