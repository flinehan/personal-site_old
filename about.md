My name is Frank Linehan, and I'm a web developer. I have a passion for the web and enjoy working with the various web based technologies and languages.

I am currently working for [LiveRez](http://www.liverez.com/) as a Web Developer specializing in Java Script. From September 2013, I have worked in the customer facing development team. We drive and improve the way property managers use software.

I live in Boise, Idaho and enjoy climbing, travel, and of couse web development. I like using new technology and patterns.

In late 2012, I worked at [Netmark](http://www.netmark.com) primarily as a Web Developer and for a time as a project manager. I implemented SCRUM, with experience on the SCRUM planning cycle, from release pre-planning through sprint and capacity planning.

At Netmark, I helped design and implement 'Netmark tools' using angular.js. The single page app communicated with a rest api written in php-code ignitor.

I am fortunate to have worked with some amazing people. And with those people, I have had the opportunity to work on some truly awesome projects.

I'm extremely excited to be working in web development during this exciting time on the web.
