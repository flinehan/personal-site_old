title: Personal Design Sprints
---


Staying on track and following through with personal projects is a real struggle for me, whether it’s building an app or developing a website. At work, I am able complete projects on time adhering to all the requirements, but all my personal projects somehow end up in a prototype graveyard and most of them don’t even get out of the design phase. I would complete a part of the redesign, only to become distracted and start a redesign of the redesign.

After reading articles from the Google Ventures team about design sprints, I decided to implement their ideas and apply them to this redesign of my website.

I am going to keep it simple and follow the schedule set by Google Ventures:
