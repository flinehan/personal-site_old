title: Day 4 Prototype
---

This has been my favorite day! Take all of the ideas, sketches, and notes build a prototype.

I built my  prototypes using html, css, and node as a basic web server. I could have built the prototype in something else, but I am much more “comfortable” working with html and css. If this was an app prototype then I would have used a tool to create the sketches.

Some advice that really stood out to me: use real text, maybe use code, create a plan for testing.

##Prototype

Lots of material design inspiration. I decided to use materialize css [http://materializecss.com](http://materializecss.com/) to speed up the development/prototype. I admit this prototype is really close to being  fully functional, outside of some content/code cleanup.

Settled on using a hamburger menu, a few particle effects. It actually looks the most like the last few sketches from the crazy 8.

Post page, focus on being simple and easy to read. In some of my ideas there were a lot of complicated sketches, but I settled on keeping things simple.

##Why Code?
I am a developer first, designer second. It was faster for me, to put the prototype together using real code. The benefit of this is that it will be really easy to take the prototype and turn it into a real project.

##Thoughts
Like I said this has been my favorite day. It allowed me to build my ideas out. And with all the sketches from the first three phases of the sprint, building the prototype was really easy. At each step of the prototype it was easy to look at the sketches and see what each part needed to do.
