title: Personal Design Sprints
---


Finding a way to complete personal projects is a real struggle, whether its building an app or a website. At work I complete projects on time to the requirements, but all my personal projects somehow end up in a prototype graveyard and most of them don’t even get out of the design phase.

I would start a project and work on it until I either lost interest or became distracted by the next framework. After some thought and reading I realized I wasn't holding myself to a deadline. I took my website down about a year ago and promised to redesign it and host it on my new domain (this domain). I would complete a part of the redesign, only to become distracted and start a redesign of the redesign.

After reading some articles from the  Google Ventures  team about design sprints, I decided to take what they have done and apply it to the redesign of my website.

There was something magical about a tight time constraint combined with individual work, prototyping, and quick user feedback.

I am going to keep it simple and follow the schedule set out by Google Venture’s:

1. Understand
2. Diverge
3. Decide
4. Prototype
5. Validate
