The goal for the final day is to share the prototype with users outside of your company. This for me was pretty easy, since I was the user. I was also the only one on the project, which meant I could share it with everyone.

The key questions that I wanted answered when I shared the prototype.

**Is the site’s design aesthetically appealing?**

This is a hard question to get an answer for since it is sort of subjective. The overall feedback was positive, but it seemed plain and was lacking something to complete it.

**Does it follow the material design guide?**

Yes, it does to a point. The feedback I recieved was to follow the material design guide closer.

**Are the color choices visually accessible?**

Feedback for this was a very positive. Testers enjoyed the colors.

**Is the design audience appropriate?**

This question, is a difficult one to get an answer for, since I am the audience kind of and so are the visitors to the blog. The site is mostly a collection of thoughts and concepts for programing. All things being equal this is just a simple blog website and the feedback that I recieved was that it was easy to read and appealing, which must mean it is audience appropriate. This will require more testing in the future.

##Whats next?

If you are reading this then it means that the blog went live (yay) and if it looks different from the initial prototype (which it does) then I applied some of the feedback that was given.

##Closing Thoughts

I was mostly making this for myself, but testing was done with a handful of people. I do plan or applying the design sprint phases in other personal projects in the future. Since the constraints set an end point and a deadline that I can work towards.

This first run was a little interesting since I wasn’t on a team and the product I was working on was my blog. There aren’t a whole lot of unique challenges creating a blog. So in future projects the design sprints will definitely translate better.

##Technology Choices
The technology that I decided on was Jekyll, since the templating is easy, posts are written in markdown, and a static site makes for easy deployment.

##The Future
Future changes for the project will be to add some transitions and animations, as they follow the material design guide.
