title: Day 2 Diverge
---




Another [Google venture](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-divergeday2) post to go with this.The diverge step is when “everyone” breaks off and creates as many ideas as possible.

Day 2 breaks down like this: 1.) Choose part of the problem, 2.) Take notes, 3.) Mind map, 4.) Crazy eights, 5.) Storyboard, 6.) Silent critique, 7.) Three-minute critiques, and 8.) Super vote. The last 2 steps are for teams, but everything thing else will translate really well for a solo project.

##Break it down
Take a part of the story and run the 8 steps on it, repeat for each part. Not breaking any barriers or ideas here, just building a simple website. The site will on be a handful of pages, so the story/project could be broken down like this:

<ol>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Blog Posts</li>
</ol>

##Mind Map
Take all of the ideas and loosely organize them onto paper.

Questions that I asked:

<ul>
  <li>Design Language?</li>
  <li>Canvas particle effects?</li>
  <li>Off screen nav with hamburger icons?</li>
  <li>Will home have recent blog posts? Or should this be its own page? </li>
  <li>Now each one of these problems should get addressed in the next group of activities.</li>
</ul>


##Crazy 8s
Take a piece of paper and fold it up into 8 sections. Then you have about 5 mins to sketch out your ideas, which comes out to 40 seconds per section. I will tell you right now that goes by extremely quickly.

##Story Board
Now take the ideas that you have generated and create a drawing of an actual UI that will be shared with the group. This is still just a sketch, no prototypes yet! In a team setting this sketch needs to stand alone, without any an explanation, presentation, or your name. The Google Venture team says to give it a catchy name.

##Critiques? Super Vote?
No critiques today, since I am running this solo. I will mention in a team setting this would be one of the most important steps

## Thoughts

This day was very high levle, which is good. It helped to take part of the problem and then focus it down with the sketches and storyboards. This day transalted really well to a solo project, but I am sure that having a team would definitly improve the value this day provides.
