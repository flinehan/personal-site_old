title: Day 2 Diverge
---




Another [Google venture](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-divergeday2) post to go with this.The diverge step is when “everyone” breaks off and creates as many ideas as possible.

Day 2 breaks down like this: 1.) Choose part of the problem, 2.) Take notes, 3.) Mind map, 4.) Crazy eights, 5.) Storyboard, 6.) Silent critique, 7.) Three-minute critiques, and 8.) Super vote. The last 2 steps are for teams, but everything thing else will translate really well for a solo project.

##Break it down
Take a part of the story and run the 8 steps on it, repeat for each part. Not breaking any barriers or ideas here, just building a simple website. The site will on be a handful of pages, so the story/project could be broken down like this:

  1.Home
  2.About
  3.Blog Posts

##Mind Map
Take all of the ideas and loosely organize them onto paper.

Questions that I asked:

<ul>
  <li>Design Language?</li>
  <li>Canvas particle effects?</li>
  <li>Off screen nav with hamburger icons?</li>
  <li>Will home have recent blog posts? Or should this be its own page? </li>
  <li>Now each one of these problems should get addressed in the next group of activities.</li>
</ul>


##Crazy 8s
Take a piece of paper and fold it up into 8 sections. Then you have about 5 mins to sketch out your ideas, which comes out to 40 seconds per section. I will tell you right now that goes by extremely quickly.

##Story Board
Now take the ideas that you have generated and create a drawing of an actual UI that will be shared with the group. This is still just a sketch, no prototypes yet! In a team setting this sketch needs to stand alone, without any an explanation, presentation, or your name. The Google Venture team says to give it a catchy name.

STORY BOARD

##Critiques? Super Vote?
No critiques today, since I am running this solo. I will mention in a team setting this would be one of the most important steps
