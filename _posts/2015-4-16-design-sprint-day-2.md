title: Day 2 Diverge
---




Here is the [Google venture](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-divergeday2) post to go with day two.The diverge step is when “everyone” breaks off and creates as many ideas as possible.

Day 2 breaks down like this: 1.) Choose part of the problem, 2.) Take notes, 3.) Mind map, 4.) Crazy eights, 5.) Story board, 6.) Silent critique, 7.) Three-minute critiques, and 8.) Super vote. The last two steps are for teams, but everything thing else will translate really well for a solo project.

##Break it down
Take a part of the story and run the eight steps. Repeat this process for each part of the story. My goal is to build a simple website. The site will only be a handful of pages, so the story could be broken down like this:

<ol>
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Blog Posts</li>
</ol>

##Mind Map
Take all of the ideas and loosely organize them onto paper.

Questions I asked:

<ul>
  <li>Design language?</li>
  <li>Canvas particle effects?</li>
  <li>Off screen nav with hamburger icons?</li>
  <li>Will Home have recent blog posts? Or should this be its own page? </li>
</ul>

Now each one of these problems should get addressed in the next group of activities.

##Crazy 8s
Take a piece of paper and fold it into eight sections. You now have about five minutes to sketch out your ideas. This comes out to 40 seconds per section. I will tell you right now it goes by extremely fast.

##Story Board
Now take the ideas you have generated and create a drawing of an actual UI that will be shared with the group. This is still just a sketch, no prototypes yet! In a team setting, this sketch needs to stand alone, without any an explanation, presentation, or your name.

##Critiques? Super Vote?
No critiques today, since I am running this solo.In a team setting this would be one of the most important steps.

## Thoughts
It helped to take part of the problem and then focus it down with the sketches and story boards. This day translated well to a solo project, but I am sure having a team would definitely improve the value of this day.
