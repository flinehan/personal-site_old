title: Day 1 Understand
---

Take the idea, dig into it, and understand the problem. In this case, my problem isn’t anything unique; it’s a blog.



Enjoy this article [Product Design Sprint day 1](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-understandday-1). There is no team this time, except for when I talk to my wife and friends about my ideas.

##Why?
I am creating this website so I can share ideas and display my projects. The audience would be other web developers.

##Existing Solutions?
There are existing blog platforms like wordpress I could use, but I want something that allows me more control such as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) or even something custom using Node. For the design sprint, I’m not worried about the technology, but more the general look and feel.

##Lightning Demos aka Inspiration
Jake Knapp describes this as:
>Look at competitors’ products. It can also be helpful to look at non-competitive products that solve a similar kind of problem in a different market.

I wouldn’t call other blogs competitors simply because the web thrives when people are able to share their ideas. If my ideas help another developer on a problem or to understand a concept, the whole industry can benefit. If software development is an ocean and the developers are ships, a rising tide raises the whole industry not just one individual.

Over the past six months, I’ve gathered about 100+ links of inspiration, best practice, and stuff that made me say, “I really like that.” I captured some screen shots and created a mood board:

##How will I know this is successful?
Jake Knapp wrote an article about the [HEART](http://www.gv.com/lib/how-to-choose-the-right-ux-metrics-for-your-product) framework which breaks success into metrics: happiness, engagement, adoption, retention, and task success. Each one of the these are assigned goals, signals, and metrics. For a detailed breakdown, take a look at the article.

For this sprint, I am aiming for happiness and engagement metrics. After the redesign launches, I will come back to adoption, retention, and task success. Going through this process will be a success for me in itself.

##Thoughts
The first day works better with groups. However, it has been useful to look at inspiration and to think about the design of the website.
