title: Day 1 Understand
---

Take the idea dig into it and ‘understand’ the problem. In this case the problem isn’t anything unique. A blog website for blog posts.



Enjoy this article [Product Design Sprint day 1](http://www.gv.com/lib/the-product-design-sprint-understandday-1). No team this time, except for when I talk to my wife and friends about my ideas.

##Why
I am creating this website so I have a place to share ideas and display projects I have worked on. The market, if you could call it that, would be other Front end devs.

##Existing Solutions?
I don’t want to use an existing blog platform like wordpress, I want something that allows me more control such as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) or even something custom using Node. At this point I am not so much worried about the technology as the general look and feel.

##Lightning demos aka Inspiration
Jake Knapp describes this as:
>Look at competitors’ products. It can also be helpful to look at non-competitive products that solve a similar kind of problem in a different market.

I wouldn’t call any of the other sites out there competitors. The web thrives because people are able to share their ideas. If my ideas help another developer on a problem or to understand a concept it helps the whole industry. If software development is an ocean and the developers were ships, a rising tide raises the whole industry not just one individual.

Over the course of time (6 months) I have gathered about 100+ links of inspiration, best practice, and stuff that made me say “I really like that.” I captured some screen shots and created a mood board:

##How will i know this is successful?
Another link from Jake Knapp to the [HEART](http://www.gv.com/lib/how-to-choose-the-right-ux-metrics-for-your-product) framework that breaks metrics into happiness, engagement, adoption, retention, and task success.

Each one of the metrics are assigned Goals, Signals, and Metrics. For a detailed breakdown of each of those take a look at the whole article.

For this, I am really just aiming for happiness and engagement. After the redesign launches I will comeback to Adoption, Retention, and Task Success. Seriously just going through this process will be a success in itself and launching will be even better.
