title: Day 3 Decide/Converge
---

Day 3! Lots of brainstorming was done on the previous days and now is the time to gather them together and purse one of the solutions.

##Look out for conflicts
Since I am all solo on this project, there weren't a ton of conflicts. Although I had some different ideas for the general look and feel of the website.

**Should there only be posts?** In a few of the sketches I had some projects on the home page. For now I will just put posts on this and at a later date add a portfolio.

**Design Language...** Should I create my own style, pick a framework, or do both. As of right now I am looking at the Google's Material Design, since it 'answers' most of my exisiting design choices I would be making.

##Assumptions

I am, more or less, the main user for this project. Identifying assumptions was rather difficult.

* Look at overall traffic to the site.
* Test and apply user feedback on the project.
* Make sure it looks good!

Assumptions aren't worth a whole lot with out a test plan. To test these I will be looking at user feedback and analytics after the site launches.

##User StoryBoard

This storyboard is to focus the team on what will be prototyped. In my case, the problem I have is no unique since its a simple website. So I will be skipping this step and move on towards the prototype day.

##Thoughts
This was the day to focus down the ideas generated and pick the "good ones." It would have translated really well in a team enviroment, but worked well for a solo project.
